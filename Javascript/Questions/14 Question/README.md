## Question 14

### Even numbers are divisible by 2 and the remainder is zero. How do you check, if a number is even or not using JavaScript? Create a program which checks that the given number is even or odd

```javascript

let num = 5;

if(num%2==0){
    console.log("This is a Even Number");
}else{
    console.log("This is a Odd Number");
}

```
